Errors discovered:
- After a round completes and last tile is placed, there is a logic error, and sometimes a segmentation fault
- Adding the last tile to Line 6 (Broken) causes an out_of_range error

Features that needs implementation:
- saved game function needs to be integrated into saveGamePage() in pages.cpp
