Group Name: Green Dino

Group Members:

Week 8 Task (Ongoing):
Choice of where to use linked list, vector & array
- Tiles in TileBag: array (good for shuffling tiles, tiles only removed from the top)
- Tiles in LidBox: linked list (only receives tiles during the game and delete the entire linked list at the end of the game)
- Tiles in Centre: vector (tiles would need to be accessed from any position the list and resized quickly)
- Tiles in PatternLine: array (fixed length of arrays needed, namely of size 1,2,3,4,5)
- Tiles in Factory: vector (tiles would need to be accessed from any position the list and resized quickly)
- Tiles in PenaltyLine: linked list (only receives tiles during the game and just need to return its length every round)
(add more if u can think of any)
